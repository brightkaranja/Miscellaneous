    <h2>Quality analysis</h2>
    <p>It is the identifing of a problem, generating corrective action, verifing them and implimenting corrective action.</p>
    <p>There are different types Quality Assurance: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preventive - It prevents defects and errors from occuring.</li>
        <li>Detective - Identifing and fixing errors occuring.</li>
        <li>Corrective - Fixing problems that arise during and after production. </li>
        <li>Assessment - Ensure the consistency and reliability of a product. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some of the software development life cycles are</p>
    <Ul>
        <li>Waterfall model</li>
        <li>Agile model</li>
        <li>Prototype model</li>
        <li>V-model</li>
        <li>Big bang model</li>
    </Ul>
    <p>There are different types of testing. Examples are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Manual testing - It is the testing performed manually by a human tester.</li>
        <li>Automated testing - Testing that is executed using automated script.</li>
        <li>Functional testing - Validates and evaluate system attributes like performance, security and usability.</li>
        <li>Non-functional testing - Evaluates if the application works as expected.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>UX research</h2>
    <p>UX Research involves the identifying what the users are going through and finding the most effective way of solving their problems.</p>

    <p>There are stages of Human Centered Design like emphathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test</p>
    <p>There are the five key stages in the human centered design including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emphathy - This is the understanding of the users.</li>
        <li>Define - This is the clear staging of the problems.</li>
        <li>Ideate - This is the coming up with multiple solutions.</li>
        <li>Prototype - This is the coming up with a simple version of the solutions.</li>
        <li>Test - This is the getting of feedback from the real users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A design is a pattern designed from repetition of shapes.</p>
    <p>Design is none in shapes which can be geometric or organic shapes.</p>

    <p>Designs are ideation from different people in reference with the users.</p>
    <h2>DAS</h2>
    <p>There are parts of a computer like the hardware and the software parts.</p>
    <p>Every part of a computer has it's own function like RAM stores information temporarily.</p>
    <p>All computers are logged to base two in their operating system.</p>
    <p>The speed of a computer depends on the storage available tothe CPU.</p>
    <p>Memory controller manages the flow of data to and from the computer's main memory.</p>
    <h2>Product management</h2>
    <p>A product manager identifies a customer need and the larger business objective that a product will fulfil.</p>

        <li>Delivery - This is the deploying of the product to the users.</li>
        <li>Measure and improve - This is the testing and maintaining of the final product.</li>
